1. **Array Sorting**: Both input arrays are sorted to simplify the intersection counting process.
2. **Intersection Counting**: Two pointers are used to traverse both arrays simultaneously, comparing elements efficiently. If the absolute difference between the elements is at most one, it's considered an intersection, and the count is incremented.
3. **Output**: The count of intersections is computed and can be used further as needed.
